Aims
==================
The present project contributes to an overall purpose of developing wearable technologies to objectively and longitudinally measure young children’s (≤3yrs) health behaviours and physiological states within their everyday activity and lives.

The specific aims of the present study are: 

1. To pilot methods for collecting in-depth, multimodal, concurrent accelerometry, heart rate, cortisol, and sleep data in young children in their everyday settings. 

2. To develop and validate analytic methods for the resulting data. 

The specific questions the present study seeks to answer relate to both the feasibility of data collection and the quality of the data collected.

Ethics
==================
This study has been granted ethical approval by the ethics committee of the Faculty of Medical Sciences at Newcastle University. 

What will the research involve
==================
The study involves up to four steps. If you decide to take part, you and your child can stop at any of the steps – you do not have to go through all of them. You can also choose to skip steps, and you can make those decisions at any time.
Steps 1 and 2 happen at the University, on a single visit lasting 60-90 minutes.
Step 1: Is to meet us in person, to get setup for the study. 
-	Get to know the researchers. 
-	Introduce your child to a heart rate monitor and allow you to take a look at other possible technologies.
-	Collect initial information about how the heart rate monitor is working, and what you and your child think about wearing it.

Step 2: If you and your child are happy to continue, we will also invite you to do a short, 10-minute, video-recorded play session with your child.
-	To ensure you and your child are comfortable with the heart rate monitor and any other technology you may choose. 
-	To collect more detailed information about how your child’s movements might relate to their heart rate, and
-	For you to complete a further questionnaire. 

After step 2, if you are happy to continue, you can take the heart rate monitor and any other technologies home with you. From home, you can continue to take part in the study for up to seven days. This is with support from us.

Step 3 At home measurement:
-	Your child can continue to wear the heart rate monitor for as long as they and you are comfortable (up to a maximum of seven days) while living their usual everyday activities. 
-	Parents who opt in for them, can complete diaries, and/or a further questionnaire. 
-	A researcher (Emily) with particular experience in doing research alongside families will visit children and families who opt in for a visit. 
-	Parent hands back the sensor at the end of the recording period (maximum seven days), and parents who opt-in for it, will provide a hair sample for their child.

Step 4 a feedback session with you, at your preferred location.
-	We will provide feedback to you on your child’s specific data
-	This will be within 2-3 weeks from the end of your study participation. 

Devices
==================

Core device: Bittium Heart Rate Monitor
------
<img style="float: right;" src="{{ site.url }}./Bittium_Faros.png">
-	Small and light (18 grams, 48 x 29 x 12 mm) 
-	Sticks on to the chest using a sensitive skin patch.
-	Records the electrical signal produced by the heart beat (ECG).
-	Also records movements. 


Optional Devices:
------
Emotibit
=
<img style="float: right; width: 40%;" src="{{ site.url }}./EmotiBit.webp">
-	Worn on the arm or leg, records the pulse rate, skin conductance and temperature, and movements. 
-	Short battery life so would only be worn for a short time.
-	Requires adult supervision while worn.
-	More info: https://www.emotibit.com/ 


Napping Pants (Respiration monitor)
=
<img style="float: right;" src="{{ site.url }}./napping.jpg">
-	A soft fabric with a built-in sensor, placed on top of the nappy, to track your child’s breathing while they sleep.
-	Helps us to understand the child’s sleep quality.

Data Management
==================

What data will we collect?
=
If you take part, we will hold information collected from you and your child. We seek three types of information, but you will choose which of these you are happy to provide, or not.
BASIC INFORMATION about your family and child:
-	Your contact details so that we can keep in touch with you, and
-	Short questionnaires about your child’s daily activities and everyday skills, using easy tick-boxes.

DIGITAL MEASURES of your child’s activity, sleep and body responses:
-	Your child wearing a small monitor that records their movement and heart rate.
-	Your brief notes of your child’s activities, on the days you choose to use the monitor at home.
-	Other technologies you may choose to try out.
-	Video-recordings of your child’s play.

MORE IN-DEPTH INFORMATION about your child’s everyday life, and about your experiences of the devices:
-	You providing brief spoken comments about any of the devices and technologies you look at or may choose to try out.
-	Notes by one of our researchers, from a visit to you and your child, where the researcher spends time with you. This is only if you agree, and the time and location would be chosen by you. 

Most of this information is optional, and you will be able to choose which parts you want to be involved in, and which devices your child wears. If you choose to stop taking part in the study at any point, we will retain the information you have provided so far but will not collect any more or new information. 

All information will be stored securely. Some information will be used for the study management only, and not be shared with anyone outside the research team at any point, now or in the future.
Some information will be further processed, to make it non-identifiable. This means removing anything that would allow you or your be identified. These non-identifiable data will then be used to answer the research questions, and may be shared with other researchers and students, and published.

For all study participants we will collect:
- Temporarily for study management only: Names, addresses, date of birth, video recordings 
- For long term storage within the study team only: sex, child’s views on devices, core device ECG recordings, core device movement recordings (acceleration), information on the child’s developmental capacity. 
- For non-identifiable analysis, use and sharing: age in months, sex, index of multiple deprivation, themes about children’s views, ECG recordings, acceleration recordings, developmental capacity summary descriptions

For all participants who wish to use the ethnographic research methods we will collect:
- Temporarily for study management only: the researcher’s diary notes; parent diary notes; observations made by the researcher; video recordings and/or photos within daily life.
- For long term storage within the study team only: A confidential, unique study ID linking the data to a study participant.
- For non-identifiable analysis, use and sharing and sharing with other researchers: non-identifiable summary of diary information, non-identifiable summary of observations, non-identifiable video/photos 

For all participants who wear the Emotibit we will collect:
- For long term storage within the study team only: A confidential, unique study ID linking the data to a study participant.
- For non-identifiable analysis, use and sharing and sharing with other researchers: photoplethysmogram (pulse rate) recordings, humidity and temperature recordings, accelerometer (movement) recordings, skin conductance recordings, body temperature recordings. 

For all participants who wear the respiration monitor (napping pants) we will collect:
- For long term storage within the study team only: A confidential, unique study ID linking the data to a study participant.
- For non-identifiable analysis, use and sharing and sharing with other researchers:  respiration rate, and movements (collected only during sleep), allowing us to assess sleep quality.
- 
For all participants who wear the Maiju Suit we will collect:
- For long term storage within the study team only: A confidential, unique study ID linking the data to a study participant.
- For non-identifiable analysis, use and sharing and sharing with other researchers:  detailed acceleration and gyroscope data that allows identification of movement types (collected only for a short period of time). 

For all participants who have hair sample taken we will collect:
- For long term storage within the study team only: A confidential, unique study ID linking the data to a study participant.
- For non-identifiable analysis, use and sharing and sharing with other researchers:  concentration of cortisol in the hair sample.
