
How do we measure the behavioural, sleep and stress physiology of children in the everyday environments?
------

The present project contributes to an overall purpose of developing wearable technologies to objectively and longitudinally measure young children’s (≤3yrs) health behaviours and physiological states within their everyday activity and lives.

The specific aims of the present study are: 

1. To pilot methods for collecting in-depth, multimodal, concurrent accelerometry, heart rate, cortisol, and sleep data in young children in their everyday settings. 

2. To develop and validate analytic methods for the resulting data. 

The specific questions the present study seeks to answer relate to both the feasibility of data collection and the quality of the data collected.
