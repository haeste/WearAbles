Aims
------
The present project contributes to an overall purpose of developing wearable technologies to objectively and longitudinally measure young children’s (≤3yrs) health behaviours and physiological states within their everyday activity and lives.

The specific aims of the present study are: 

1. To pilot methods for collecting in-depth, multimodal, concurrent accelerometry, heart rate, cortisol, and sleep data in young children in their everyday settings. 

2. To develop and validate analytic methods for the resulting data. 

The specific questions the present study seeks to answer relate to both the feasibility of data collection and the quality of the data collected.

Ethics
------
This study has been granted ethical approval by the ethics committee of the Faculty of Medical Sciences at Newcastle University. 

Devices
------
Core device: Bittium Heart Rate Monitor
-	Small and light (18 grams, 48 x 29 x 12 mm) 
-	Sticks on to the chest using a sensitive skin patch.
-	Records the electrical signal produced by the heart beat (ECG).
-	Also records movements.

Optional Devices:
Emotibit
-	Worn on the arm or leg, records the pulse rate, skin conductance and temperature, and movements. 
-	Short battery life so would only be worn for a short time.
-	Requires adult supervision while worn.
