The study involves up to four steps. If you decide to take part, you and your child can stop at any of the steps – you do not have to go through all of them. You can also choose to skip steps, and you can make those decisions at any time.
Steps 1 and 2 happen at the University, on a single visit lasting 60-90 minutes.

Step 1: Is to meet us in person, to get setup for the study. 

-	Get to know the researchers. 
-	Introduce your child to a heart rate monitor and allow you to take a look at other possible technologies.
-	Collect initial information about how the heart rate monitor is working, and what you and your child think about wearing it.

Step 2: If you and your child are happy to continue, we will also invite you to do a short, 10-minute, video-recorded play session with your child.

-	To ensure you and your child are comfortable with the heart rate monitor and any other technology you may choose. 
-	To collect more detailed information about how your child’s movements might relate to their heart rate, and
-	For you to complete a further questionnaire. 

After step 2, if you are happy to continue, you can take the heart rate monitor and any other technologies home with you. From home, you can continue to take part in the study for up to seven days. This is with support from us.

Step 3 At home measurement:

-	Your child can continue to wear the heart rate monitor for as long as they and you are comfortable (up to a maximum of seven days) while living their usual everyday activities. 
-	Parents who opt in for them, can complete diaries, and/or a further questionnaire. 
-	A researcher (Emily) with particular experience in doing research alongside families will visit children and families who opt in for a visit. 
-	Parent hands back the sensor at the end of the recording period (maximum seven days), and parents who opt-in for it, will provide a hair sample for their child.

Step 4 a feedback session with you, at your preferred location.

-	We will provide feedback to you on your child’s specific data
-	This will be within 2-3 weeks from the end of your study participation.
