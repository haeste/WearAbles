What data will we collect?
------
If you take part, we will hold information collected from you and your child. We seek three types of information, but you will choose which of these you are happy to provide, or not.
BASIC INFORMATION about your family and child:
-	Your contact details so that we can keep in touch with you, and
-	Short questionnaires about your child’s daily activities and everyday skills, using easy tick-boxes.

DIGITAL MEASURES of your child’s activity, sleep and body responses:
-	Your child wearing a small monitor that records their movement and heart rate.
-	Your brief notes of your child’s activities, on the days you choose to use the monitor at home.
-	Other technologies you may choose to try out.
-	Video-recordings of your child’s play.

MORE IN-DEPTH INFORMATION about your child’s everyday life, and about your experiences of the devices:
-	You providing brief spoken comments about any of the devices and technologies you look at or may choose to try out.
-	Notes by one of our researchers, from a visit to you and your child, where the researcher spends time with you. This is only if you agree, and the time and location would be chosen by you. 

Most of this information is optional, and you will be able to choose which parts you want to be involved in, and which devices your child wears. If you choose to stop taking part in the study at any point, we will retain the information you have provided so far but will not collect any more or new information. 

All information will be stored securely. Some information will be used for the study management only, and not be shared with anyone outside the research team at any point, now or in the future.
Some information will be further processed, to make it non-identifiable. This means removing anything that would allow you or your be identified. These non-identifiable data will then be used to answer the research questions, and may be shared with other researchers and students, and published.

For all study participants we will collect:
- Temporarily for study management only: Names, addresses, date of birth, video recordings 
- For long term storage within the study team only: sex, child’s views on devices, core device ECG recordings, core device movement recordings (acceleration), information on the child’s developmental capacity. 
- For non-identifiable analysis, use and sharing: age in months, sex, index of multiple deprivation, themes about children’s views, ECG recordings, acceleration recordings, developmental capacity summary descriptions

For all participants who wish to use the ethnographic research methods we will collect:
- Temporarily for study management only: the researcher’s diary notes; parent diary notes; observations made by the researcher; video recordings and/or photos within daily life.
- For long term storage within the study team only: A confidential, unique study ID linking the data to a study participant.
- For non-identifiable analysis, use and sharing and sharing with other researchers: non-identifiable summary of diary information, non-identifiable summary of observations, non-identifiable video/photos 

For all participants who wear the Emotibit we will collect:
- For long term storage within the study team only: A confidential, unique study ID linking the data to a study participant.
- For non-identifiable analysis, use and sharing and sharing with other researchers: photoplethysmogram (pulse rate) recordings, humidity and temperature recordings, accelerometer (movement) recordings, skin conductance recordings, body temperature recordings. 

For all participants who wear the respiration monitor (napping pants) we will collect:
- For long term storage within the study team only: A confidential, unique study ID linking the data to a study participant.
- For non-identifiable analysis, use and sharing and sharing with other researchers:  respiration rate, and movements (collected only during sleep), allowing us to assess sleep quality.
- 
For all participants who wear the Maiju Suit we will collect:
- For long term storage within the study team only: A confidential, unique study ID linking the data to a study participant.
- For non-identifiable analysis, use and sharing and sharing with other researchers:  detailed acceleration and gyroscope data that allows identification of movement types (collected only for a short period of time). 

For all participants who have hair sample taken we will collect:
- For long term storage within the study team only: A confidential, unique study ID linking the data to a study participant.
- For non-identifiable analysis, use and sharing and sharing with other researchers:  concentration of cortisol in the hair sample.
